# Convex Polyhedron - Basic Structure

This file defines the basic structure of a convex polyhedron using V-representation
(vertex representation) as the convex hull of a finite set of points.

## Main definitions

* `ConvexPolyhedron E` - A convex polyhedron as convex hull of finitely many vertices
* `ConvexPolyhedron.vertices` - The vertices of the polyhedron
* `ConvexPolyhedron.dim` - Affine dimension of the polyhedron
* `affineDim` - Helper for computing affine dimension

## Main results

* `ConvexPolyhedron.compact` - Every polyhedron is compact
* `ConvexPolyhedron.convex` - Every polyhedron is convex
* `ConvexPolyhedron.bounded` - Every polyhedron is bounded
* `ConvexPolyhedron.extremePoints_eq_vertices` - Extreme points are exactly vertices

## Implementation notes

This is the foundation for the Euler polyhedron formula formalization. The polyhedron
is represented as a finite set of vertices that are exactly the extreme points of their
convex hull (irredundancy condition).

/-- The affine dimension of a set is the dimension of its affine span.

For a set in an affine space, this is the rank of the direction (vector space) of the
affine span. An affine space of dimension d requires d+1 affinely independent points.

Examples:
- A single point has affine dimension 0
- A line segment has affine dimension 1
- A triangle has affine dimension 2
- A tetrahedron has affine dimension 3

/-- A convex polyhedron as the convex hull of finitely many points (V-representation).

This is the primary definition for formalizing Euler's polyhedron formula. The polyhedron
is represented as a finite set of vertices that are exactly the extreme points of their
convex hull (irredundancy condition). The polyhedron itself is the convex hull of these
vertices.

The `vertices_are_extreme` field ensures that:
- No vertex can be expressed as a convex combination of other vertices
- The vertex set is minimal (removing any vertex changes the polyhedron)
- Two polyhedra with the same convex hull have the same vertices

Note: This representation automatically ensures boundedness and compactness. -/
