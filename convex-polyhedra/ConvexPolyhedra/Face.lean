# Faces of Convex Polyhedra

This file defines faces of convex polyhedra using the V-representation.
A face is an exposed face: a subset obtained by maximizing a linear functional.

## Main definitions

* `ConvexPolyhedron.Face` - A face structure with supporting functional
* `ConvexPolyhedron.Face.toSet` - The underlying set of a face
* `ConvexPolyhedron.Face.dim` - Affine dimension of a face
* `ConvexPolyhedron.faces` - Faces of a given dimension
* `ConvexPolyhedron.incident` - Incidence relation between faces

## Main results

* `faces_finite` - Finitely many faces in each dimension (to be proven)
* Incidence properties: irreflexive, asymmetric

## Implementation notes

For V-representation, a face is characterized by a supporting hyperplane that achieves
its maximum on the polyhedron exactly at that face.

/-- All vertices in a face achieve the same value under the supporting functional.
This is a direct consequence of is_maximal: each vertex in F.vertices maximizes
F.support over all of P.vertices, so they all achieve the maximum value. -/
theorem support_const_on_face_vertices (F : Face P) :
    ∀ v ∈ F.vertices, ∀ v' ∈ F.vertices, F.support v = F.support v' := by
  intro v hv v' hv'
  -- Both v and v' maximize F.support over P.vertices (by is_maximal)

/-- The supporting functional is constant on the face.
Since all vertices achieve the same value M, and the functional is linear,
all points in the convex hull also achieve M. -/
theorem support_const_on_face (F : Face P) (hne : F.vertices.Nonempty) :
    ∀ x ∈ F.toSet, ∀ v ∈ F.vertices, F.support x = F.support v := by
  intro x hx v hv
  -- The proof requires showing that linear functionals preserve the constant value
  -- on convex combinations. This follows from:
  -- If x = Σᵢ λᵢ vᵢ where all vᵢ achieve value M, then F.support x = Σᵢ λᵢ M = M
  sorry

/-- Every face of a polytope is an exposed face.

This connects our `Face` structure to Mathlib's `IsExposed` predicate from
`Analysis.Convex.Exposed`. Our Face structure is defined to be exposed by
construction (via the supporting functional), but this theorem makes the
connection explicit.

The key insight: For polytopes (convex hull of finitely many points), every
face is exposed. This is a fundamental theorem in polytope theory that
distinguishes polytopes from general convex sets, where faces may exist that
are not exposed.

This theorem is crucial for leveraging Mathlib's exposed face theory in our
proofs. -/

      -- KEY INSIGHT: By analyzing the Face definition, we discovered that is_maximal
      -- implies all vertices in F.vertices achieve the SAME value M.
      -- This dramatically simplifies the proof!

      -- Get nonemptiness of F.vertices from h_nonempty
      have hF_nonempty : F.vertices.Nonempty := by
        sorry  -- Can derive from h_nonempty : F.toSet.Nonempty

      -- Get a vertex to establish the maximum value M
      obtain ⟨v, hv⟩ := hF_nonempty

      -- By support_const_on_face, F.support x = F.support v = M (once proven)
      have hx_eq : F.support x = F.support v := by
        sorry  -- Would follow from support_const_on_face once proven

      -- By is_maximal, v maximizes over P.vertices
      have hv_max : ∀ w ∈ P.vertices, F.support w ≤ F.support v := by
        exact (F.is_maximal v (F.subset hv)).mp hv

      sorry  -- Need: F.support y ≤ max over P.vertices (requires convex hull lemma)
  · -- Reverse direction: x ∈ P and x maximizes F.support → x ∈ F.toSet
    intro ⟨hx_in_P, hx_max⟩
    -- KEY INSIGHT: Combined with support_const_on_face_vertices, the maximality
    -- condition forces x to be in convexHull F.vertices.

    -- Proof strategy (using our helper lemmas):
    -- 1. Let M = max {F.support v | v ∈ P.vertices}
    -- 2. Since x maximizes, F.support x = M
    -- 3. Write x = Σᵢ λᵢ vᵢ where vᵢ ∈ P.vertices
    -- 4. F.support x = Σᵢ λᵢ (F.support vᵢ) = M (by linearity)
    -- 5. Since each F.support vᵢ ≤ M and the weighted average equals M,
    --    all vᵢ with λᵢ > 0 must have F.support vᵢ = M
    -- 6. By is_maximal, these vᵢ ∈ F.vertices
    -- 7. By support_const_on_face_vertices, all such vᵢ achieve the same value
    -- 8. Therefore x ∈ convexHull F.vertices = F.toSet
    --
    -- The key observation: is_maximal characterizes F.vertices as EXACTLY
    -- the maximizers, and support_const_on_face_vertices shows they all
    -- achieve the same value.

/-- The k-dimensional faces form a finite set (key theorem).

## Proof Strategy

Each face is determined by which subset of vertices maximizes a linear functional.
Since P.vertices is finite, there are only finitely many possible vertex subsets.

## What's Needed for Complete Proof

1. **Face lattice theory**: Faces of a convex polytope form a finite lattice
2. **Counting argument**: For each dimension k, only finitely many vertex subsets
   can form k-dimensional faces (bounded by affine independence constraints)
3. **Exposed face finiteness**: Mathlib may have results about finite face structures
   for polytopes (see `Mathlib.Analysis.Convex.Exposed`)

## Current Status

This is left as sorry for now. The geometric fact is standard: a polytope defined as
the convex hull of finitely many points has finitely many faces of each dimension.
The full formalization would benefit from:
- Connecting to Mathlib's exposed face theory
- Developing face lattice structure
- Using combinatorial bounds on faces (e.g., upper bound theorem) -/

/-- Incidence relation: a (k-1)-face is on the boundary of a k-face -/
def incidentFaces (P : ConvexPolyhedron E) (k : ℕ) (F : Face P) (G : Face P) : Prop :=
  F.dim = k - 1 ∧ G.dim = k ∧ F.toSet ⊆ G.toSet

/-- Decidable instance for face incidence (for computation).
This requires checking dimension equality and set containment.
For now, we use Classical.dec since the full decidability proof is complex. -/
noncomputable instance (P : ConvexPolyhedron E) (k : ℕ) (F G : Face P) :
    Decidable (incidentFaces P k F G) :=
