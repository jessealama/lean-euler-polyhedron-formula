# Faces of Convex Polyhedra

This file defines faces of convex polyhedra using the V-representation.
A face is an exposed face: a subset obtained by maximizing a linear functional.

## Main definitions

* `ConvexPolyhedron.Face` - A face structure with supporting functional
* `ConvexPolyhedron.Face.toSet` - The underlying set of a face
* `ConvexPolyhedron.Face.dim` - Affine dimension of a face
* `ConvexPolyhedron.faces` - Faces of a given dimension
* `ConvexPolyhedron.incident` - Incidence relation between faces

## Main results

* `faces_finite` - Finitely many faces in each dimension (to be proven)
* Incidence properties: irreflexive, asymmetric

## Implementation notes

For V-representation, a face is characterized by a supporting hyperplane that achieves
its maximum on the polyhedron exactly at that face.

/-- Every face of a polytope is an exposed face.

This connects our `Face` structure to Mathlib's `IsExposed` predicate from
`Analysis.Convex.Exposed`. Our Face structure is defined to be exposed by
construction (via the supporting functional), but this theorem makes the
connection explicit.

The key insight: For polytopes (convex hull of finitely many points), every
face is exposed. This is a fundamental theorem in polytope theory that
distinguishes polytopes from general convex sets, where faces may exist that
are not exposed.

This theorem is crucial for leveraging Mathlib's exposed face theory in our
proofs. -/

    -- 3. Let M = max {F.support v | v ∈ P.vertices}. Since x maximizes, F.support x ≥ M

/-- The k-dimensional faces form a finite set (key theorem).

## Proof Strategy

Each face is determined by which subset of vertices maximizes a linear functional.
Since P.vertices is finite, there are only finitely many possible vertex subsets.

## What's Needed for Complete Proof

1. **Face lattice theory**: Faces of a convex polytope form a finite lattice
2. **Counting argument**: For each dimension k, only finitely many vertex subsets
   can form k-dimensional faces (bounded by affine independence constraints)
3. **Exposed face finiteness**: Mathlib may have results about finite face structures
   for polytopes (see `Mathlib.Analysis.Convex.Exposed`)

## Current Status

This is left as sorry for now. The geometric fact is standard: a polytope defined as
the convex hull of finitely many points has finitely many faces of each dimension.
The full formalization would benefit from:
- Connecting to Mathlib's exposed face theory
- Developing face lattice structure
- Using combinatorial bounds on faces (e.g., upper bound theorem) -/

/-- Decidable instance for face incidence (for computation).
This requires checking dimension equality and set containment.
For now, we use Classical.dec since the full decidability proof is complex. -/
