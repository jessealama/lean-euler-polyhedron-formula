# Faces of Convex Polyhedra

This file defines faces of convex polyhedra using the V-representation.
A face is an exposed face: a subset obtained by maximizing a linear functional.

## Main definitions

* `ConvexPolyhedron.Face` - A face structure with supporting functional
* `ConvexPolyhedron.Face.toSet` - The underlying set of a face
* `ConvexPolyhedron.Face.dim` - Affine dimension of a face
* `ConvexPolyhedron.faces` - Faces of a given dimension
* `ConvexPolyhedron.incident` - Incidence relation between faces

## Main results

* `faces_finite` - Finitely many faces in each dimension (to be proven)
* Incidence properties: irreflexive, asymmetric

## Implementation notes

For V-representation, a face is characterized by a supporting hyperplane that achieves
its maximum on the polyhedron exactly at that face.

This is the relation we use in the boundary map: for each k-face G, we sum over
all (k-1)-faces F that are incident to it.

Note: This is directional - F is incident to G means F ⊆ G and dim F = dim G - 1. -/

/-- The k-dimensional faces form a finite set (key theorem).

## Proof Strategy

Each face is determined by which subset of vertices maximizes a linear functional.
Since P.vertices is finite, there are only finitely many possible vertex subsets.

## What's Needed for Complete Proof

1. **Face lattice theory**: Faces of a convex polytope form a finite lattice
2. **Counting argument**: For each dimension k, only finitely many vertex subsets
   can form k-dimensional faces (bounded by affine independence constraints)
3. **Exposed face finiteness**: Mathlib may have results about finite face structures
   for polytopes (see `Mathlib.Analysis.Convex.Exposed`)

## Current Status

This is left as sorry for now. The geometric fact is standard: a polytope defined as
the convex hull of finitely many points has finitely many faces of each dimension.
The full formalization would benefit from:
- Connecting to Mathlib's exposed face theory
- Developing face lattice structure
- Using combinatorial bounds on faces (e.g., upper bound theorem) -/
theorem faces_finite (P : ConvexPolyhedron E) (k : ℕ) : (P.faces k).Finite := by

/-- Incidence relation: a (k-1)-face is on the boundary of a k-face -/
def incidentFaces (P : ConvexPolyhedron E) (k : ℕ) (F : Face P) (G : Face P) : Prop :=
  F.dim = k - 1 ∧ G.dim = k ∧ F.toSet ⊆ G.toSet

/-- Decidable instance for face incidence (for computation).
This requires checking dimension equality and set containment.
For now, we use Classical.dec since the full decidability proof is complex. -/
noncomputable instance (P : ConvexPolyhedron E) (k : ℕ) (F G : Face P) :
    Decidable (incidentFaces P k F G) :=
  Classical.dec _
