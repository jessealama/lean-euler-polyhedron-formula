# V-Representation of Convex Polyhedra

This file defines convex polyhedra using the vertex (V-) representation:
a polyhedron is the convex hull of a finite set of points.

## Main definitions

* `ConvexPolyhedron E` - A convex polyhedron as convex hull of finitely many vertices
* `ConvexPolyhedron.vertices` - The vertices of the polyhedron
* `ConvexPolyhedron.extremePoints` - Extreme points (subset of vertices)
* `ConvexPolyhedron.dim` - Affine dimension of the polyhedron
* `ConvexPolyhedron.Face` - A face as an exposed subset
* `ConvexPolyhedron.faceChainComplex` - Chain complex from face lattice

## Main results

* `ConvexPolyhedron.compact` - Every polyhedron is compact
* `ConvexPolyhedron.convex` - Every polyhedron is convex
* `ConvexPolyhedron.bounded` - Every polyhedron is bounded
* `ConvexPolyhedron.extremePoints_eq_vertices` - Extreme points are exactly vertices (by definition)
* `ConvexPolyhedron.faces_finite` - Finitely many faces in each dimension
* `ConvexPolyhedron.boundary_comp_boundary` - ∂² = 0 (chain complex property)
* `ConvexPolyhedron3D.isHomologicalSphere` - 3D polyhedra have sphere homology
* `ConvexPolyhedron3D.euler_formula` - V - E + F = 2

## Strategy for Euler's Formula

The proof follows this path:
1. Build a chain complex from the face lattice of the polyhedron (over ZMod 2)
2. Define boundary maps ∂ₖ: Cₖ → Cₖ₋₁ from face incidence relations
3. Prove ∂² = 0 (boundary of boundary is zero)
4. Compute homology groups Hₖ = ker(∂ₖ) / im(∂ₖ₊₁)
5. Show that convex polyhedra in ℝ³ are homological spheres: H₀ ≅ ZMod 2, H₁ ≅ 0, H₂ ≅ ZMod 2
6. Apply Euler-Poincaré formula: χ = Σ(-1)ᵏ dim Hₖ = 1 - 0 + 1 = 2
7. Also χ = Σ(-1)ᵏ (# of k-faces) = V - E + F
8. Therefore V - E + F = 2

Note: We work over ZMod 2 to avoid orientation issues in the boundary maps. The chain
groups are indexed by all integers k ∈ ℤ (with trivial groups for k < 0).

## Implementation notes

This is the primary representation for Euler's polyhedron formula because:
1. Vertices, edges, and faces arise naturally from the face lattice
2. All polyhedra in this representation are automatically bounded
3. The Mathlib theory of extreme points and exposed faces applies directly
4. The convex hull is well-studied in Mathlib with many useful lemmas

We work in general finite-dimensional inner product spaces, specializing to ℝ³
when needed.

/-- A convex polyhedron as the convex hull of finitely many points (V-representation).

This is the primary definition for formalizing Euler's polyhedron formula. The polyhedron
is represented as a finite set of vertices that are exactly the extreme points of their
convex hull (irredundancy condition). The polyhedron itself is the convex hull of these
vertices.

The `vertices_are_extreme` field ensures that:
- No vertex can be expressed as a convex combination of other vertices
- The vertex set is minimal (removing any vertex changes the polyhedron)
- Two polyhedra with the same convex hull have the same vertices

Note: This representation automatically ensures boundedness and compactness. -/

/-- The k-dimensional faces form a finite set (key theorem).

## Proof Strategy

Each face is determined by which subset of vertices maximizes a linear functional.
Since P.vertices is finite, there are only finitely many possible vertex subsets.

## What's Needed for Complete Proof

1. **Face lattice theory**: Faces of a convex polytope form a finite lattice
2. **Counting argument**: For each dimension k, only finitely many vertex subsets
   can form k-dimensional faces (bounded by affine independence constraints)
3. **Exposed face finiteness**: Mathlib may have results about finite face structures
   for polytopes (see `Mathlib.Analysis.Convex.Exposed`)

## Current Status

This is left as sorry for now. The geometric fact is standard: a polytope defined as
the convex hull of finitely many points has finitely many faces of each dimension.
The full formalization would benefit from:
- Connecting to Mathlib's exposed face theory
- Developing face lattice structure
- Using combinatorial bounds on faces (e.g., upper bound theorem) -/

## Face Lattice Structure

Faces of a convex polyhedron form a graded lattice under the subset relation.
The grading is given by the dimension function.

Key properties:
- The subset relation F.toSet ⊆ G.toSet defines a partial order on faces
- The incidence relation is the "covering relation": F incident G ↔ F ⊂ G and no face strictly between
- Dimension gives the grading: faces at level k have dimension k
- The lattice is bounded (has minimum and maximum elements)

This lattice structure is fundamental to the face theory and chain complex construction.

/-- The chain group of k-dimensional faces (functions from k-faces to ZMod 2).

We work over ZMod 2 to avoid orientation issues. Each face either appears (1) or
doesn't appear (0) in a boundary, and we only care about parity.

The chain groups are indexed by all integers k ∈ ℤ. For k < 0, the index set is
PUnit (trivial type), making this the trivial module.

Using functions (rather than Finsupp) simplifies the type class instances
and makes the boundary map definition much cleaner. -/
def chainGroup (P : ConvexPolyhedron E) (k : ℤ) : Type _ :=
  P.facesIndexSet k → ZMod 2

/-- The chain group is an AddCommGroup via the Pi structure -/
instance (P : ConvexPolyhedron E) (k : ℤ) : AddCommGroup (P.chainGroup k) :=
  Pi.addCommGroup

/-- The chain group is a Module over ZMod 2 via the Pi structure -/
instance (P : ConvexPolyhedron E) (k : ℤ) : Module (ZMod 2) (P.chainGroup k) :=
  Pi.module _ _ _

/-- Boundary map: sends a k-face to the formal sum of its (k-1)-faces.

For a k-face G, ∂(G) = Σ F where F ranges over (k-1)-faces on the boundary of G.
Working over ZMod 2 means we don't need orientation signs - we just sum all incident
(k-1)-faces modulo 2.

The map extends linearly to the entire chain group by:
∂(Σᵢ aᵢ·Gᵢ) = Σᵢ aᵢ·∂(Gᵢ)

For k ≤ 0, the boundary map is the zero map (source is trivial).

This follows the pattern from Polyhedron.lean, using functions instead of Finsupp
for simpler type class inference.

This lemma states that a nested sum with conditionals can be rewritten as a sum

The pattern is:
```
Σ_F [if P1(F) then Σ_G [if P2(F,G) then f(G) else 0] else 0]
=
Σ_G [f(G) * card{F | P1(F) ∧ P2(F,G)}]

-- The proof involves nested case analysis and double summations over face lattices
-- which require substantial elaboration time, particularly in the main k≥2 case
-- where we expand the composition of boundary maps and apply the diamond property.
/-- The boundary of a boundary is zero: ∂² = 0.

This is the key algebraic property that makes the face lattice into a chain complex.

The proof relies on the diamond property: each (k-2)-face H appears in ∂²(G) exactly
as many times as there are (k-1)-faces F with H ⊆ F ⊆ G. By the diamond property,
this count is always 2 (for codimension 2 pairs), which equals 0 in ZMod 2.

Working over ZMod 2, any even count becomes 0, so ∂²(G) = 0 for each k-face G.
By linearity, ∂² = 0 on the entire chain group.

/-- A convex polyhedron in ℝ³ is a homological 2-sphere.

Working over ZMod 2, this means:
- H₀(P) ≅ ZMod 2 (connected, one component)
- H₁(P) ≅ 0 (no "1-dimensional holes")
- H₂(P) ≅ ZMod 2 (encloses a 3D region, one "2-dimensional cavity")

This is the key topological property that makes the Euler formula work. -/

/-- The two definitions of Euler characteristic coincide.

This follows from the Euler-Poincaré formula, which states that for any chain complex:
χ = Σ(-1)ᵏ · rank(Hₖ) = Σ(-1)ᵏ · rank(Cₖ)

This is the main theorem! It follows from:
1. isHomologicalSphere: H₀ ≅ ℤ, H₁ ≅ 0, H₂ ≅ ℤ
2. Therefore χ = dim H₀ - dim H₁ + dim H₂ = 1 - 0 + 1 = 2
