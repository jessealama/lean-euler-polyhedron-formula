# V-Representation of Convex Polyhedra

This file defines convex polyhedra using the vertex (V-) representation:
a polyhedron is the convex hull of a finite set of points.

## Main definitions

* `ConvexPolyhedron E` - A convex polyhedron as convex hull of finitely many vertices
* `ConvexPolyhedron.vertices` - The vertices of the polyhedron
* `ConvexPolyhedron.extremePoints` - Extreme points (subset of vertices)
* `ConvexPolyhedron.dim` - Affine dimension of the polyhedron
* `ConvexPolyhedron.Face` - A face as an exposed subset
* `ConvexPolyhedron.faceChainComplex` - Chain complex from face lattice

## Main results

* `ConvexPolyhedron.compact` - Every polyhedron is compact
* `ConvexPolyhedron.convex` - Every polyhedron is convex
* `ConvexPolyhedron.bounded` - Every polyhedron is bounded
* `ConvexPolyhedron.extremePoints_eq_vertices` - Extreme points are exactly vertices (by definition)
* `ConvexPolyhedron.faces_finite` - Finitely many faces in each dimension
* `ConvexPolyhedron.boundary_comp_boundary` - ‚àÇ¬≤ = 0 (chain complex property)
* `ConvexPolyhedron3D.isHomologicalSphere` - 3D polyhedra have sphere homology
* `ConvexPolyhedron3D.euler_formula` - V - E + F = 2

## Strategy for Euler's Formula

The proof follows this path:
1. Build a chain complex from the face lattice of the polyhedron (over ZMod 2)
2. Define boundary maps ‚àÇ‚Çñ: C‚Çñ ‚Üí C‚Çñ‚Çã‚ÇÅ from face incidence relations
3. Prove ‚àÇ¬≤ = 0 (boundary of boundary is zero)
4. Compute homology groups H‚Çñ = ker(‚àÇ‚Çñ) / im(‚àÇ‚Çñ‚Çä‚ÇÅ)
5. Show that convex polyhedra in ‚Ñù¬≥ are homological spheres: H‚ÇÄ ‚âÖ ZMod 2, H‚ÇÅ ‚âÖ 0, H‚ÇÇ ‚âÖ ZMod 2
6. Apply Euler-Poincar√© formula: œá = Œ£(-1)·µè dim H‚Çñ = 1 - 0 + 1 = 2
7. Also œá = Œ£(-1)·µè (# of k-faces) = V - E + F
8. Therefore V - E + F = 2

Note: We work over ZMod 2 to avoid orientation issues in the boundary maps. The chain
groups are indexed by all integers k ‚àà ‚Ñ§ (with trivial groups for k < 0).

## Implementation notes

This is the primary representation for Euler's polyhedron formula because:
1. Vertices, edges, and faces arise naturally from the face lattice
2. All polyhedra in this representation are automatically bounded
3. The Mathlib theory of extreme points and exposed faces applies directly
4. The convex hull is well-studied in Mathlib with many useful lemmas

We work in general finite-dimensional inner product spaces, specializing to ‚Ñù¬≥
when needed.

/-- A convex polyhedron as the convex hull of finitely many points (V-representation).

This is the primary definition for formalizing Euler's polyhedron formula. The polyhedron
is represented as a finite set of vertices that are exactly the extreme points of their
convex hull (irredundancy condition). The polyhedron itself is the convex hull of these
vertices.

The `vertices_are_extreme` field ensures that:
- No vertex can be expressed as a convex combination of other vertices
- The vertex set is minimal (removing any vertex changes the polyhedron)
- Two polyhedra with the same convex hull have the same vertices

Note: This representation automatically ensures boundedness and compactness. -/

/-- The k-dimensional faces form a finite set (key theorem).

## Proof Strategy

Each face is determined by which subset of vertices maximizes a linear functional.
Since P.vertices is finite, there are only finitely many possible vertex subsets.

## What's Needed for Complete Proof

1. **Face lattice theory**: Faces of a convex polytope form a finite lattice
2. **Counting argument**: For each dimension k, only finitely many vertex subsets
   can form k-dimensional faces (bounded by affine independence constraints)
3. **Exposed face finiteness**: Mathlib may have results about finite face structures
   for polytopes (see `Mathlib.Analysis.Convex.Exposed`)

## Current Status

This is left as sorry for now. The geometric fact is standard: a polytope defined as
the convex hull of finitely many points has finitely many faces of each dimension.
The full formalization would benefit from:
- Connecting to Mathlib's exposed face theory
- Developing face lattice structure
- Using combinatorial bounds on faces (e.g., upper bound theorem) -/

We work over ZMod 2 to avoid orientation issues. Each face either appears (1) or
doesn't appear (0) in a boundary, and we only care about parity.

The chain groups are indexed by all integers k ‚àà ‚Ñ§. For k < 0, the index set is
empty, making this the trivial module. -/

For a k-face G, ‚àÇ(G) = Œ£ F where F ranges over (k-1)-faces on the boundary of G.
Working over ZMod 2 means we don't need orientation signs - we just sum all incident
(k-1)-faces modulo 2.

The map extends linearly to the entire chain group by:
‚àÇ(Œ£·µ¢ a·µ¢¬∑G·µ¢) = Œ£·µ¢ a·µ¢¬∑‚àÇ(G·µ¢)

/-- The boundary of a boundary is zero: ‚àÇ¬≤ = 0.

This is the key algebraic property that makes the face lattice into a chain complex.

The proof relies on a fundamental combinatorial fact: each (k-2)-face H appears in
‚àÇ¬≤(G) exactly as many times as there are k-1 faces F containing H that are themselves
contained in the k-face G. In the boundary of a face, this count is always even
(it equals the number of ways to choose 2 facets of a simplex-like structure).

Working over ZMod 2, any even count becomes 0, so ‚àÇ¬≤(G) = 0 for each k-face G.
By linearity, ‚àÇ¬≤ = 0 on the entire chain group. -/
